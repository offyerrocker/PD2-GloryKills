todo:

figure out the "proper" way to trigger death logic AND death animations
- death logic shouldn't do anything to the unit that would cause a crash with other players
	- freeze the unit, preventing it from taking action
		- this entails disabling the brain ai and unregistering it with the groupai state/manager
	- kill the unit, counting as a kill
		- needs to call on-kill listeners like in playermanager
- death animations
	- can't be interrupted by other idle animations
	- does it need to be an "action"?
	- ideally it should be automatically triggered via the damage_whatever function, 
	  where the usual listeners are called,
	  so the only difference would be which animation is chosen






	
execution_slap first slap of the cop weapon to the side
execution_punch punch
execution_grab grabbing the cop's head
execution_kill headbutt
death presumed ragdoll timing so at this trigger i thought itd be ok to turn the cop into a ragdoll
also the player animation is 46 frames long
the cop animation is 71

test triggering death anim from calling listeners

check if custom state syncing will crash unmodded clients
